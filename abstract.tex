\section{Abstract}

This paper summarizes different methods for sampling based summary
statistics discussed in the paper written by Gibbons and Matias
\cite{GM98}. We present new methods developed by the authors called
concise samples and counting samples. Following Gibbons and Matias
arguments we estimate the usefulness of
this methods and compare them to different solution for obtaining
approximate query answers. As the paper by Gibbons and Matias was
written in 1998 we shortly present the new ideas that emerge since
that time.
