\section{Abstract}
This paper summarizes different methods of sampling based summary
statistics for improving approximate query answers discussed by Gibbons and Matias
\cite{GM98}. We present two new sampling based statistics, developed by
those authors, concise samples and counting samples, analyze algorithms to
maintain them in presence of insertion and delation of tuples and
briefly compare them to standard sample views.
Finally, we show a practical application of concise and counting
samples to provide fast approximate answers to hot list queries.
