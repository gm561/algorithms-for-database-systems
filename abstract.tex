\section{Abstract}
This paper summarizes different methods for sampling based summary
statistics discussed by Gibbons and Matias in
\cite{GM98}. In particular we present two new approaches, developed by
those authors, concise samples and counting samples. What is more, we
analyze application of this methods to \textit{hot list queries}.

% Following Gibbons and Matias
% arguments we estimate the usefulness of
% this methods and compare them to different solution for obtaining
% approximate query answers. As the paper by Gibbons and Matias was
% written in 1998 we shortly present the new ideas that emerge since
% that time.
