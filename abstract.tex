\section{Abstract}
This paper summarizes different methods for sampling based summary
statistics discussed by Gibbons and Matias
\cite{GM98}. We present the new techniques developed by
those authors - concise samples and counting samples. We analyze algorithms to
maintain the samples in presence of insertion and delation of tuples
stored in data warehouse and consider the application
of concise and counting samples to provide fast approximate answers to \textit{hot list queries}.

% Following Gibbons and Matias
% arguments we estimate the usefulness of
% this methods and compare them to different solution for obtaining
% approximate query answers. As the paper by Gibbons and Matias was
% written in 1998 we shortly present the new ideas that emerge since
% that time.
