\section{Abstract}
This paper summarizes different methods for sampling based summary
statistics discussed by Gibbons and Matias
\cite{GM98}. We present new structures developed by
those authors - concise samples and counting samples, analyze algorithms to
maintain them in presence of insertion and delation of tuples
stored in data warehouse.  Finally, we show a practical application
of concise and counting samples to provide fast approximate answers
to hot list queries.
